## 1 What is a Neural Network ##

- instead of predefine what the hideen layer's output stands for, such as family size, let Neural Network itself decide whatever it will will produce

- given large amount of `(x,y)`, neural network will produce high accurate mapping


## 2 Basics of Neural Network Programming

- loss function 是针对任意一个样本，本质是distance function
- cost function 是针对整个样本集 

### 3 1 Hidden Layer of Neural Networks

### 3 2 Deep Neural Networks
