## 1 简介 ##

> `make`: the program to automate the process of transforming source code into an executable. It defines the relationship between source code, intermediate files, and executables. In short, `make` can be considered the center of the development process by providing a roadmap of an application's components and how they fit together. The principle value of make comes from its ability to perform the complex series of commands necessary to build an application and to optimize these operations when possible to reduce the time taken by the edit-compile-debug cycle. Furthermore, make is flexible enough to be used anywhere one kind of file depends on another from traditional programming in C/C++ to Jva, Tex, database management and more.

## 2 Basic Concepts ##

### 2.1 A Simple Makefile

{% highlight makefile linenos %}

target: prereq_1, prereq_2  #rule
    commands                #command
{% endhighlight %} 

When make is asked to evaluate a rule, it begins by finding the files indicated by the prerequisites and target. If any of the prerequisites has an associated rule, make attempts to update those first. Next, the target file is considered. If any prerequisite is newer than the target, the target is remade by executing the commands. Each command line is passed to the shell and is executed in its own subshell. If any of the commands generates an error, the building of the target is terminated and `make` exits. One file is considered newer than another if it has been modified more recently.

{% highlight makefile linenos %}
hellomake: hellomake.c hellofunc.c
	gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I.
{% endhighlight %}

### 2.2 Rules

> Rule: each rule includes a target (a file) and prerequisites(files). When execute make the top rule, it will check if prerequisites has new modified date than the target. If yes, it will execute the following command. Since the target of one rule can be referenced as a prerequisite in another file, the set of targets and prerequisites form a chain or graph of dependencies (short for "dependency graph"). Building and processing this dependency graph to update the requested target is what make is all about.

#### 2.2.1 Explicit Rule

> Explicit Rule: specifies particular files as targets and prerequisites, `hellomake: hellomake.c hellofunc.c`.

#### 2.2.2 Wildcards Rule

> Wildcards Rule: `prog: *.c` means prog is dependent of all .c files.

#### 2.2.3 Phony Target

Phony Target

{% highlight makefile linenos %}
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f *.o lexer.c
{% endhighlight %}

`.PHONY:` Always execute the commands associated with clean even if a file named clean exists.


#### 2.2.4 Empty Targets




### 2.3 Variables and Macros

{% highlight makefile linenos %}
${var}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 2.3.1 Automatic Variables

{% highlight makefile linenos %}
$@  # The file name respresenting the target
$%  # The filename element of an archive member specification
$<  # The filename of the first prerequisite
$?  # The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.
$^  # The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces.
$+  # Similar to $^, the name of all the prerequisites separated by spaces,
$*  # The stem of the target filename.
{% endhighlight %}
