## 3 Vim help

`:help` to enter help mode

- `/R` to find topic about `R`.
- one way to remember left as `h` and right as `l` is h is on the left of right hand how row while l on the right

## 4 Vim Golf

- `.` repreat last command. For example, `A;` append ; to the end, `j.` will go to next line and repeat `A;`.

- `2e`, cursor go to next 2nd word's last character; `2b` cursor go to previous 2nd word's first character.

- write and quit
  - `:wq`, write and quit, even though no change, this command will update file modification time even if the file is not changed
  - `:x`, `ZZ`: `:x` is the same as `ZZ` except `ZZ` is 2 strokes while `:x` is 3 (extra `<CR>`), write and quit. Unlike `:wq`  this command will NOT update file modification time even if the file is not changed.

- `3ai<ESC>`: repeat 3 times of `ai<ESC>`. `<ESC>` is a must here to return from insert mode to normal mode.

- `CTRL-V` visual block mode, `CTRL-V` `GA;<ESC>`, 在所有行最后加;
