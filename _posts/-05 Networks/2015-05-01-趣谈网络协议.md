### 1.1 `ping` program

The name "ping" is taken from the sonar operation to locate objects. The Ping program is used to test whether another host is reachable. The program sends an ICMP echo request message to a host, expecting an ICMP echo reply to be returned. 

1. Normally if you can't Ping a host, you won't be able to Telnet or FTP to that host. Conversely, if you can't Telnet to a host, ping is often the starting point to determine what the problem is. 

2. Ping also measures the round-trip time to the host, giving us some indication of how "far away" that host is. 

3. Ping is a diagnostic tool and can be used to further explore ICMP. 

4. Ping also examine the IP record route and timestamp options.

5. Nowadays, Ping may shoa a host as being unreachable, yet we might be able to Telnet to poart 25(the mall server).


## 2 Transport Layer

TCP是成熟的社会人，UDP是头脑简单的小朋友。TCP复杂，UDP简单；TCP维护链接，UDP谁都相信；TCP会坚持知进退；UDP愣头青一个，勇往直前。但是，UDP协议看起来简单，恰恰提供了巨大的扩展空间。


### 2.1 TCP

TCP， 因性恶而复杂，先恶后善反轻松

- TCP提供可靠交付，通过TCP传输的数据，无差错，不丢失，不重复，并且按序到达。
- TCP可以有拥塞控制。它意识到包丢了或者网络环境不好，就会根据情况调整自己的行为，看看是不是发快了，要不要发慢点。UPD就不会，应用让我发，我就发，管它洪水滔天。

拥塞堵塞:




#### 2.1.0 TCP Introduction
TCP Segment: TCP 报文段

Socket: combination of an IP address and a port number
Socket Pair (a unique TCP connection): 4-tuple consisting of the client IP address and port, server IP address and port. It's a formal name of a reference to a IP connection (which underhood is actually the address (IP + port) info for bothe ends)

Sequence Number: Byte ID

Flags:
- SYNC: hand shake. A SYNC consume one sequence number, for example 1230, means this packet's sequence number is 1230.
- FIN: sender is finish sending data, for hand wave
- ACK: acknowledgements number (the sender has successfully sent up through but not including that byte) is valid
- URG: the urgent pointer is valid, and segment advances on receiver's buffer to be handled urgently. Used when Telnet or Rlogin the interactive user types the interrupt key; or FTP, user aborts a file transfer.
- PSH: the receiver should pass this data to application as soon as possible
- RST: Reset the connection. A common case for generating a reset is when a connection request arrives and no process is listening on the destination port. In the case of UDP an ICMP port unreachable ws generated when a datagram arrived for a destination port that was not in use. TCP instead uses a RST.

TCP Connection is full-duplex, each direction is independent of the other.

Option: the most common option field is maximum segement size option, called MSS. It is normally included on the first segment exchanged. MSS, the largest "chunk" of data that the sender is expected to receive. In general, the large the MSS the better (since it amortizes the IP and TCP header), until fragmentation occurs. When TCP sends a SYN segment(either active or passive open), it can send an MSS value up to the outoing interface's MTU, minus the size of fixed TCP(20 bytes) and IP(20 bytes) headers.

TCP can be described as a sliding window protocal without selective or negative acknoledgement. If 1-1024 are received, 2049-3072 are received then, all receiver can ack is 1025; If 1-1024 are received, 2049-3072 are received then with incorrect checksum, all receiver can ack is 1025. 

TCP flow control:
- sender: Congestion Avoidance, the flow control imposed by the sender, based on the sender's perceived network congestion. 
- receiver: Window Size Advertisements, flow control imposed by the receiver, based on the amount of available buffer space at the receiver for this connection.
- Both ends can be both sender and receiver.

sliding window rwnd是怕发送方把接收方缓存塞满，而拥塞窗口cwnd是怕把网络塞满。

#### 2.1.1 TCP Connection Establishment and Termination



3 way hand-shade
- active open
- passive open
- ISN (initial sequence number)


4 way hand-wave
- half close: I'm done sending data, so I will send a FIN to the other end, but I still can receive data from the other end, until it sends me a FIN.
- active close
- passive close
- 2MSL wait state: 保证ack没有丢包，已经被receive接受， 否则在"ack arrive receiver + receiver send FIN and arrive sender" period receiver重传的FIN已经被sender在2MSL时间内接收(it repeats stay in 2MSL wait state with new timer)。在2MSL之间收到的data都不会被接收，kernel不能reuse还在2MSL内的socket pair。这两个特性保证了基于同一个socekt pair(ip, port for both receiver and sender)新的connection不会误收到之前socket pair connection的遗留包。这导致的另一个常见现象是当terminate一个client的connection后，重启client到同一个server的链接会显示"cannot bind local address: Address already in use"(因为这个socket pair 还在2MSL state, `nestat`命令会显示这个信息)。In summary, 2MSL wait provides protection against delayed segements from an earlier incanation of a connection from being interpreted as part of a new connection that uses the same local and foreign IP addresses and port bumbers.
- quiet time: 2MSL state crash and reboot, TCP will not allow new connection beingesbablished for the same socket paire in this case. 
- orderly release: terminate a connection for one side by send a FIN.
- abortive release: terminate a connection for one side by send a RST.
- half open. P249.
- simultaneous open: both sides perform active open at the same time.
- simultaneous close: both sides perform active close at the same time (needs an extra state, CLOSING, from FIN_WAIT1). 
- TCP server design. Server port number:
140.252.13.33.23			140.252.13.65.1030	ESTABLISHED (receive incoming data segment)
140.252.13.33.23			140.252.13.65.1029	ESTABLISHED (receive incoming data segment)
*.23									*.* 								Listen (receive incoming connection request (SYN))
; 
Restricting local IP address
140.252.13.33.23		140.252.13.65.1030	ESTABLISHED (这个不会出现，因为服务器只监听来自140.252.1.29的网卡)
140.252.1.29.23			140.252.13.65.1029	ESTABLISHED (receive incoming data segment)
140.252.1.29.23			*.* 								Listen (receive incoming connection request (SYN))
; Restricting foreign IP address; 


Incoming connection request queue：a concurrent server invokes(`fork`) a new process to handle each client, so the listening server should always be ready to handle the next incoming connection request. But wait, what if listening server is busy? Normally, a incoming connection request queue is used. If the queue is not full, any sync request will cause kernel to finish 3 way-shaking; otherwise ignore and the sender will keep sending sync request until timeout. The listening server application, when not busy, will dequeue the connection in the incomming connection request queue, and check if the ip and port address is for itself, if so, use it for sending data; else close connection by either sending FIN or RST. This means, tcp listening server has no way to cause a client's active open to fail. When a new client connection is passed to the server applicatoin, TCP three-way handshake is over, and the client's active open has completed successfully. If the server then looks at the client's IP address and port number, and decides it doesn't want to service this client, all the server can do is either close the connection via FIN or reset via RST. In either case the client thought everything was OK when its active open completed and may have already sent a request to the server. Keep in mind TCP module in kernel can ack received data before the application has read and processed that data, for example when a advertised windown size of 4096 appears 4095 in the ack message, means recevier's segmenet is still in TCP kernel buffer and hasn't been read by the application.



> Q: 为什么握手是3次而挥手是4次？因为链接和挥手的过程不一样！握手时其实也可以4次(将第2次拆分为两步)，A-(SYNC)->B, B-(ACK)->A, B-(SYNC)->A, A-(ACK)->B； 就像挥手时A-(FIN)->B, B-(ACK)->A, B-(FIN)->A, A-(ACK)->B一样4次。但是连接时可以合并为A-(SYNC)->B, B-(ACK，SYNC)->A, A-(ACK)->B 3次；挥手时不能合并，因为 B-(ACK)->A和B-(FIN)->A之间，B可能还有数据要发送给A,等所有发送完才B-(FIN)->A。整个过程其实是**双向**链接的建立和关闭过程。The recepit of FIN only means there will be not more data flowing in that direciton. A TCP can still send data fater receiving a FIN.

TCP state machine

#### 2.1.2 TCP Interactive Data Flow

Delayed Acknowledgedment: normally, TCP does not send an ACK the instant it receives data. Instead, it delays the ACK, hoping to have data going in the same direction as the ACK, so the ACK can be sent along with the data. Delayed Acknowledgement is sent slowest at every other segments.

Nagle algorithm (used to reduce the number of small segments): when a TCP connection has outstanding data that has not yet been acknowledged, small segments cannot be sent until the outstanding data is acknowledged. In stead, small amounts of data are collected by TCP and sent in a single segment when the acknowledgment arrives. Pro, amortize tcp header payload; cons adds delayed (should disable Nagle algorithm for some application such as remote mouth movement.)

#### 2.1.3 TCP Bulk Data Flow

Window Size Advertisements: flow control imposed by the receiver, based on the amount of available buffer space at the receiver for this connection.

Sliding Window Protocol: It allows the sender to transmit multiple packets before it stops and waits for an acknowledgement. This leads to faster data tranfer, since the sender doesn't have to stop and wait for a acknowledgment each tima packet is sent.

Window Update Ack: <-ack 8194, win 0 <-ack 8194, win 4096.

PUSH Flag: 



Congestion Window: ？？？？

#### 2.1.4 TCP Timeout and Retransmission

RTT: Foundamental to TCP timeout and retransmission is the measurement of the roud-trip time (RTT). 

RTO

Congestion: detected by RTO timeout or receipt of duplicate ACKs.

Congestion Avoidance: flow control imposed by the sender, based on the sender's perceived network congestion. Congestion avoidance dictates that `cwnd` be incremented by /cwnd each time an ACK is received. This is an additive increase, compared to slow start's exponential increase. We want to increase `cwnd` by at most one segment each round-trip time (regardless how many ACKs are received in that RTT), where as slow start will increment `cwnd` by the number of ACKs received in a round-trip time.

Slow Start: get the flow of data established on a connection. It operate by observing that the rate at twhich new packets should be injected into the network is the rate at which the acknowledgements are returned by the other end. Slow start has `cwnd` start at one segment, and be incremented by one segment every time an ACK is received, which opens the window exponentially: send one segment, then two, then four, and so on.

Congestion avoidance and slow start are independent algorithms with different objectives. But when congestion occurs we want to slow down the transmission rate of packets into the network, and then invoke slow start to get things going again. In practice, they are implemented toghter by mainined two variables `cwnd`(a congestion window) and `ssthresh`(a slow start threshold size).

{: .img_middle_hg}
![broadcast domain](/assets/images/posts/-05 Network/2015-05-01-趣谈网络协议/Slow_start_and_congestion_avoidance_algo.png)

from RTT 0-4, it is slow start; after 4, which hits ssthresh, the congestion avoidance take control.

Fast Retransmit & Fast Recovery: if 3 or more duplicated ACKs are received in a row, it is highly likely to have a packet lost, so a retransmission of what appears to be the missing segment, without waiting for a retransmission timer to expire is peformed. This is the `fast retransmit` algorithm. Next, congestion avoidance, but not slow start is performed, which is called the `fast recovery` algorithm



Repacketization.

#### 2.1.5 TCP Persist Timer

TCP does not ACK acknowledgments, it only ACKs segments containing data. If an window update gets lost, it could end up with both sides waiting for the other: the receiver waiting to receive data and the sender waiting to receive the window update allowing it to send. To prevent this form of deadlock from occurring the sender uses a persist timer that causes it to query the receiver periodically, to find out if the window has been increased. These segments from the sender are called window probes. It can avoid **Silly Window Syndrome**, during which small ammounts of data are exchanged (it can be caused by either end: the receiver can advertise small windows, instead of waiting untila larger window could be advertised; and the sender can transmit small amounts of data, instead of waiting for additional data to send a larger segment.)

#### 2.1.6 TCP Keepalive Timer

If neither process at the ends of a TCP connection is sending data to the other, nothing is exchanged between the two TCP modules. There is no polling (periodical querying), for example, as you might find with other networking protocols. This means we can start a client process that establishes a TCP connection with a server and walk away for hours, days, weeks, or months, and the connection remains up. Intermediate routers can crash and reboot, phone lines may go down and backuo, but as long as neither host at the ends of the connection reboots, the connection remains established. There are times, however, when a server wants to know if the client's host has either crashed and is down, or crashed and rebooted. The `keepalive` timer, provides this capability in TCP module level, though some experts argue it should be application level protocol to provide that capability.

#### 2.1.7 TCP Futures and Performance

Path MTU discovery
- allow TCP to use windows larger than the default 536 for nonlocal connections, when the path MTU is larger. This can improve performance.
- Big Packes or Small Packets: conventional wisdom says that bigger packets are better because sending fewer big packets "cost less" than sending more smaller packets (this assumes the packets are not large enough to cause fragmentation, since that introduces another set of problems). The reduced cost is that associated with the network (packet header overhead), routers (routing decisions), and hosts (protocol processing and device interrrupts). Not everyone agrees with this.

Long fat pipes:
- window scale option; this increases the definition of the TCP window from 16 to 32 bits. Instead of changing the TCP header to accommodate the larger window, the header still holds a 16-bit value, and an option is defined that applies a scaling operation to the 16-bit value. TCP then maintains the "real" window size internally as a 32-bit value.
- timestamp option: the timestamp option lets the sender place a timestamp value in every segment. The receiver reflects this value in the acknowledgment, allowing the sender to calculate an RTT for each received ACK. (we must say "each received ACK" and not "each segment" since TCP normally acknowledges multiple segments per ACK.) Timestamp option provides protection against wrapped sequence numbers(???).

T/TCP modification: allow a client-server request-reply sequence to be completed using only three segments in the usual case. It avoids the three-way handshake and shortens the TIME_WAIT state by  caching a small amount of information for each host with which it has established a conneciton. 



### 2.2 UDP


UDP, 因性善而简单，难免碰到"城会玩"。

UDP之上的扩展。

- 网页或者APP访问。QUIC(QUICK UDP Internet COnnecitons), google提出的一种基于UDP改进的通信协议，目的是降低网络通信的延迟，提供更好的用户交互体验。QUIC在应用层上，会自己实现快速链接的建立，减少重传时延，自适应拥塞控制。

- 流媒体的协议额。当前流媒体**直播**多使用基于TCP的RTMP协议。TCP的时序特性要保证前一个收到了，下一个才能确认，如果前一个收不到，下一个就算包道林，在缓存里面，也需要等着。而直播显然不能这样，宁可丢包，也不要卡顿。因而很多直播应用，都基于UDP实现了自己的视频传输协议。

- 实时游戏。要求长连接(TCP)保证实时传输; 但是一台机器能够支持的TCP链接数目是有限的(内核需要维护TCP链接的一些数据结构)，因此在异步IO机制引入之前，UDP常常是应对海量客户端连接的策略。所以一些游戏厂商自己实现可靠的UDP协议，自定义重传策略，能够把丢包产生的延迟降到最低，尽量减少网络问题对游戏性造成的影响。

- IoT物联网。维护TCP协议资源要求多，而IoT很可能是个内存非常小的嵌入式系统；同时IoT对实时性要求也很高。Google旗下的Nest建立了Thread Group, 推出了物联网通信协议Thread,就是基于UDP协议的。

- 移动通信领域。在4G网络里，移动流量上网的数据面对的协议GTP-U是基于UDP的。因为移动网络协议比较复杂，而GTP协议本身就包含复杂的手机上线下线的通信协议。如果基于TCP, TCP的机制就显得非常多余。

### 2.3 ICMP (Internet Control Messages Protocol 网间控制报文协议)

如果收到一份UDP数据而目的端口与某个正在使用的进程不相符，那么UDP返回一个ICMP不可达报文。可以用TFTP来强制生成一个端口不可达报文。

### 2.4 IGMP

## 3 Netwokr Layer

### 3.1 IP

- IP vs Mac

IP是地址，有定位功能，定义了整个网络端到端的传输行为；MAC是身份证，无全局定位功能，有局部定位功能，定义了本地局域网的传输行为。

MAC的唯一性设计是为了组网的时候，不同的网卡放在一个网络里面的时候，可以不同担心冲突。从硬件角度，保证不同的网卡有不同的标识。MAC地址有一定的定位功能，只不过范围非常有限。你可以根据IP地址，找到杭州市网商路599号B楼6层，但是依然找不到我，你就可以靠吼了，大声喊身份证XXX是哪位？我听到了，就会站起来说，是我啊。但是如果你在上海，到处喊身份证XXX是哪位，我不在现场，当然不会回答，因为我在杭州不在上海。

所以MAC地址的通信范围比较小，局限在一个子网里面。例如从192.168.0.2/24访问192.168.0.3/24是可以用MAC地址的。一旦跨子网，即从192.168.0.2/24到192.168.1.2/24,MAC地址就不行了，需要IP地址起作用了。

- 公有IP地址 vs 私有IP地址

{: .img_middle_hg}
![broadcast domain](/assets/images/posts/-05 Network/2015-05-01-趣谈网络协议/Public_IP_VS_Private_IP.png)



- CIDR(无类型域间选路)可以用来判断是不是本地人。例如10.100.122.2/24表示前24位位网络号，后8位是主机号；子网掩码是255.255.255.0, 将其和IP地址按位计算，就可得到网络号。

### 3.1 Routing Table

## 4 MAC layer
MAC 层是用来解决多路访问堵车的问题。

hub集线器只有物理层，采取广播形式，每一个网卡发出地包，每一个链接集线器的网卡(除了源网卡)都会收到。

Switch交换机除了物理层，还有链路层。

link layer解决:

1. 这个包是发给谁的？谁应该接受？通过Mac地址(交换机有MAC地址学习能力，学完了它就知道谁在哪儿了，不用广播了,一台 MAC1 电脑将一个包发送给另一台 MAC2 电脑，当这个包到达交换机的时候，一开始交换机也不知道 MAC2 的电脑在哪个口，所以没办法，它只能将包转发给除了来的那个口之外的其他所有的口。但是，这个时候，交换机会干一件非常聪明的事情，就是交换机会记住，MAC1 是来自一个明确的口。以后有包的目的地址是 MAC1 的，直接发送到这个口就可以了。当交换机作为一个关卡一样，过了一段时间之后，就有了整个网络的一个结构了，这个时候，基本上不用广播了，全部可以准确转发。当然，每个机器的 IP 地址会变，所在的口也会变，因而交换机上的学习的结果，我们称为转发表，是有一个过期时间的。)。
2. 大家都在发，会不会产生混乱？有没有谁先发，谁后发的规则？分多个车道(信道划分),单双号分时限行(轮流协议), 有事儿先出门特堵就回去错过高峰再出来(随机介入协议，以太网就是这种策略)。
3. 发送出错，怎么办?CRC(循环冗余检测)来计算整个包是否在发送的过程中出现了错误。


如何通过IP获取MAC？ARP 协议，也就是已知 IP 地址，求 MAC 地址的协议;

ARP和RAP的请求以广播方式(broadcast)传送，应答以单播方式(unicast)传送

**交换机和VLAN**

当交换机数目越来越多的时候，会遭遇环路问题，让网络包迷路，这就需要使用STP协议，通过华山论剑比武的方式，将有环路的图变成没有环路的树，从而解决环路问题。

交换机数目多会面临隔离问题，可以通过VLAN形成虚拟局域网，从而解决广播问题和安全问题。



#### 4.1.1 网关 vs 路由器

gateway vs router. 路由器是一台设备，它有5个网口或者网卡，相当于有5只手，分别连着5个局域网。每只手的ip地址都和局域网的ip地址相同的网段，每只手都是它握住的那个局域网的网关。任何一个想发往其他局域网的包，都会到达其中一只手，被拿进来，拿下MAC头和IP头，看看，根据自己的路由算法，选择另一只手，加上IP头和MAC头，然后扔出去。


1. 路由类型

路由表

静态路由，从哪个网关进，哪个网关出，都是由一条条规则规定好的。实现原理

- 3项路由: 目标ip, 下一跳ip，出口ip,
- 策略路由: 多路由表/多路径。

动态路由实现原理：
- 距离矢量路由算法: BGP
- 链路状态路由算法: OSPF


2. 网关类型

转发网关(欧洲十国游): 局域网ip不改

NAT(Newtork Address Translate)网关(玄奘西行): 局域网ip改, 即源ip在出网关时会升级到公网ip，目标ip在入网关时会降级到局域网ip。


### 1.2 DHCP与PXE

1. 正确配置IP?

CIDR、子网掩码、广播地址和网关地址

2. DHCP & PXE

## 5 Physical Layer

## 6 查漏补缺

清晰的网络拓扑图：从理论上来讲，应该要清楚地知道一个网络包从原地址到目标地址都需要经过哪些设备，然后逐个ping中间的这些设备或者机器。如果可能，在这个关键点，通过tcpdump -i eth0 icmp, 查看包有没有到达某个点。


hub和switch用来局域网内交流(通过mac地址)，局域网与另一个局域网交流需要网关(gateway,router,通过IP。
