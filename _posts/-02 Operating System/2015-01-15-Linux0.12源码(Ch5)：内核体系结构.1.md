虚拟地址(process based) vs 线性地址 vs 物理地址(RAM-based)的意义 （分段和分页的意义）



虚拟地址(process based) vs 线性地址 vs 物理地址(RAM-based)的意义 （分段和分页的意义）(from 1_operating system, the design and implementation)

the basic idea behind virtual memory is that each program has its own address space, which broken up into chunks called pages. Each page is a contiguous space. These pages are mapped onto physical memory, but notall pages have to be in physical memory at the same time to run the program. When the program references a part of its space that is in physical memory, the hardware perfroms the necessary mapping on the fly. When the program references a part of its address space that is not in physical memory, the operating system is alerted to go get the missing piece and re-execute the instruction that failed. In a sense, virtual memory is a generalization of the base-and-limit-register idea. The 8088 had separate base registers for text and data. With virtual memory, instead of having separate relocation for just the text and data segments, the entire address space can be mapped onto physical memory in fairly small units.

The purpose of  the page table is to map virtual pages onto page frames. Mathmatically speaking, the page table is a function, with the virtual page number as argument and the physical frame number as result.

(from 3_Modern Operating Systems)

logical address used interchangeable with virtual address, generated by program, during compile and loading time.
(from 2_operating system concepts)
