##### 1. 草稿

- principle: 
    - leftmost prefix principle 最左前缀原则
- type:
    - b-tree (most common): `auto increment primary key` store the whole row by b-tree. `key(col1, col2, col3)` the column order is of great importance as leftmost prefix principle since the key is stored in b-tree with soreted order first by col1; when col1 equals, then by col2; when col1, col2 equals then by col3. so the following queries will be boosted by the index `key(col1, col2, col3)`:
        - `where col1 = AA`, `where col1 > AA`;
        - `where col1 = A`, `where col1 > AA`; // col1的prefix
        - `where col1 = A and col2 = B`; `where col1 = A and col2 > B`;
        - `where col1 = A and col2 = B and col3 = C`; `where col1 = A and col2 = B and col3 > C`; 
    if you want to query `where col1 > A and col2 = B`, you need to make another key with different order, `key(col2, col1)`.
    - hash: ligntning fast for exact match, no use for range query.
    - spatial R-tree index.

- When and when not use index: an index isn't always the right tool, indexes are effective when they help the storage engine find rows without adding more work than they avoid.
    - For small tables, it is often more effective to simply read all the rows in the table.
    - For medium to large tables, indexes can be very effective
    - For enormous tables, the overhead of indexing, as well as the work required to actually use the indexes, can start to add up. In such cases you might need to choose a technique that identifies groups of rows that are interesting to the query, instead of individual rows. You can use partitioning for this purpose.

- Index Strategies for High Performance
    - Isolating the column (indexed column must be along on one side of comparison operator): 假设bank table有13列，有id为主键，则`SELECT * FROM bank WHERE id = 10`和`SELECT * FROM bank WHERE id + 1 = 11`的结果一样，但是搜索涉及的row截然不同，使用`explain`命令可得前者row为1，后者row为13.

    - Choose good column order for index of multi-columns. The column order either enables or prevents the index from earning "starts" in Lahdenmaki and Leach's three-start system. Please place column with higher **SELECTIVITY** in front.

    - Insert rows in primary key order when using InnoDB, where auto increment surrogate key is a much better choice than uuid (you cannot guarantee later uuid is larger than previous inserted uuid, in such case, insertion needs to move rows around to keep the order) for primary key.

    - Covering index: if secondary index includes the columns and primary id that all the select requires, then secondary index B-tree lookup is enough, no need for extra table data lookup. `explain select film_id from inventory where store_id = 1;` shows `extra: using index` is exactly a flag for using covering index(why not simply renaming using index to using covering index???).
    - Clustered Index: difference between Clustered Index (InnoDB) and Non-clustered Index storage (MyISAM)

#### CH6 Query Performance Optimization

#### CH6.1 Slow Query Basics: Optimizat Data Access

##### Are You Asking the Database for Data You Don't Need?

The disadvantage of using `SELECT *`

- more IO operation (disk, and network) if what you want is get all columns from DB and then throw away what  you don't want

- if later the table alter the schema, the return result will change

- cannot take advantage of covering index.



##### Is MySQL Examining Too Much Data?

#### CH6.2 Ways to Restructure Queries

##### Complex Queries Versus Many Queries

##### Choopping Up a Query

#### Join Decomposition

#### CH6.3 Query Execution Basics

Learning how MySQL optimizes and executes queries if of vital importance for developer to get high performance of MySQL since much of optimization is a matter of reason from principles and query optimizations becomes a very logical process.

##### The MySQL Client/Server Protocol

- the connection between client and server is half-duplex, which means mysql server can be either receving or sending messages, but not both.

- `SHOW PROCESSLIST` display all the connections and its state. The important states are
    - `Sleep`: the thread is waiting for a new query from the client
    - `Query`: the thread is executing the query of sending the result back to the client
    - `Locked`: the thread is waiting for a table lock to be granted at the server level.

##### The Query Cache

##### The Query Optimization Process

- Step 1: any syntax error can be raised here, such as missing ending `\``, column references aren't ambiguous.

- Step 2: check table access privileges

- Step 3: optimize to output execution plan bi cost-based method to find the least cost option.
    - static optimization with hard coded scores for the parse tree, one can think it as `compile-time optimizations`
    - dynamic optimization with context, such as index, one can think it as `run-time optimization`
    - `MIN()` can be optimized use B-Tree index by returning the first item without necessary get all the rows and get the min value.



> How to visualize a join. Remember the optimizer can choose a different join order from the query itself based on the cost. If you have n tables to join, there are n! combination orders, mysql will not always calculate the cost of each and choose the min since it takes too long.
